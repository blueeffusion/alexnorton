Isn’t thinking essential in order to survive in this world?
Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific
task, and when the task is completed, you lay it down. As it is, I
would say about 80 to 90 percent of most people’s thinking is not onlyrepetitive and useless, but because of its dysfunctional and often
negative nature, much of it is also harmful. Observe your mind and
you will find this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital
energy.
This kind of compulsive thinking is actually an addiction. What
characterizes an addiction? Quite simply this: you no longer feel that
you have the choice to stop. It seems stronger than you. It also gives
you a false sense of pleasure, pleasure that invariably turns into pain.
Why should we be addicted to thinking?
Because you are identified with it, which means that you derive your
sense of self from the content and activity of your mind. Because you
believe that you would cease to be if you stopped thinking. As you
grow up, you form a mental image of who you are, based on your
personal and cultural conditioning. We may call this phantom self the
ego. It consists of mind activity and can only be kept going through
constant thinking. The term ego means different things to different
people, but when I use it here it means a false self, created by
unconscious identification with the mind.
To the ego, the present moment hardly exists. Only past and future
are considered important. This total reversal of the truth accounts for
the fact that in the ego mode the mind is so dysfunctional. It is always
concerned with keeping the past alive, because without it — who are
you? It constantly projects itself into the future to ensure its continued
survival and to seek some kind of release or fulfillment there. It says:
“One day, when this, that, or the other happens, I am going to be
okay, happy, at peace.” Even when the ego seems to be concerned
with the present, it is not the present that it sees: It misperceives it
completely because it looks at it through the eyes of the past. Or it
reduces the present to a means to an end, an end that always lies in
the mind-projected future. Observe your mind and you’ll see that this
is how it works.
The present moment holds the key to liberation. But you cannot find the present moment as long as you are your mind.
I don’t want to lose my ability to analyze and discriminate. I wouldn’t
mind learning to think more clearly, in a more focused way, but I don’t
want to lose my mind. The gift of thought is the most precious thing
we have. Without it, we would just be another species of animal.
The predominance of mind is no more than a stage in the evolution of
consciousness. We need to go on to the next stage now as a matter
of urgency; otherwise, we will be destroyed by the mind, which has
grown into a monster. I will talk about this in more detail later.
Thinking and consciousness are not synonymous. Thinking is only a
small aspect of consciousness. Thought cannot exist without
consciousness, but consciousness does not need thought.
Enlightenment means rising above thought, not falling back to a level
below thought, the level of an animal or a plant. In the enlightened
state, you still use your thinking mind when needed, but in a much
more focused and effective way than before. You use it mostly for
practical purposes, but you are free of the involuntary internal
dialogue, and there is inner stillness. When you do use your mind, and
particularly when a creative solution is needed, you oscillate every
few minutes or so between thought and stillness, between mind and
no-mind. No-mind is consciousness without thought. Only in that way
is it possible to think creatively, because only in that way does
thought have any real power. Thought alone, when it is no longer
connected with the much vaster realm of consciousness, quickly
becomes barren, insane, destructive.
The mind is essentially a survival machine. Attack and defense
against other minds, gathering, storing, and analyzing information —
this is what it is good at, but it is not at all creative. All true artists,
whether they know it or not, create from a place of no-mind, from
inner stillness. The mind then gives form to the creative impulse or
insight. Even the great scientists have reported that their creative
breakthroughs came at a time of mental quietude. The surprising
result of a nationwide inquiry among America’s most eminent mathematicians, including Einstein, to find out their working methods,
was that thinking “plays only a subordinate part in the brief, decisive
phase of the creative act itself.”
1 So I would say that the simple
reason why the majority of scientists are not creative is not because
they don’t know how to think but because they don’t know how to
stop thinking!
It wasn’t through the mind, through thinking, that the miracle that is
life on earth or your body was created and is being sustained. There is
clearly an intelligence at work that is far greater than the mind. How
can a single human cell measuring 1/1,000 of an inch in diameter
contain instructions within its DNA that would fill 1,000 books of 600
pages each? The more we learn about the workings of the body, the
more we realize just how vast is the intelligence at work within it and
how little we know. When the mind reconnects with that, it becomes
a most wonderful tool. It then serves something greater than itself. The more you are identified with your thinking, your likes and dislikes,
judgments and interpretations, which is to say the less present you
are as the watching consciousness, the stronger the emotional energy
charge will be, whether you are aware of it or not. If you cannot feel
your emotions, if you are cut off from them, you will eventually
experience them on a purely physical level, as a physical problem or
symptom. A great deal has been written about this in recent years, so
we don’t need to go into it here. A strong unconscious emotional
pattern may even manifest as an external event that appears to just
happen to you. For example, I have observed that people who carry a
lot of anger inside without being aware of it and without expressing it
are more likely to be attacked, verbally or even physically, by other
angry people, and often for no apparent reason. They have a strong
emanation of anger that certain people pick up subliminally and that
triggers their own latent anger.
If you have difficulty feeling your emotions, start by focusing attention
on the inner energy field of your body. Feel the body from within. This
will also put you in touch with your emotions. We will explore this in
more detail later. Success in life could be defined as the continued expansion of happiness and the progres-
sive realization of worthy goals. Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease.
And yet success, including the creation of wealth, has always been considered to be a process
that requires hard work, and it is often considered to be at the expense of others. We need a
more spiritual approach to success and to affluence, which is the abundant flow of all good
things to you. With the knowledge and practice of spiritual law, we put ourselves in harmony
with nature and create with carefulness, joy, and love.
There are many aspects to success; material wealth is only one component. Moreover,
success is a journey, not a destination. Material abundance, in all its expressions, happens to be
one of those things that makes the journey more enjoyable. But success also includes good
health, energy and enthusiasm for life, fulfilling relationships, creative freedom, emotional and
psychological stability, a sense of well-being, and peace of mind.
Even with the experience of all these things, we will remain unfulfilled unless we nurture the
seeds of divinity inside us. In reality, we are divinity in disguise, and the gods and goddesses in
embryo that are contained within us seek to be fully materialized. True success is therefore the
experience of the miraculous. It is the unfolding of the divinity within us. It is the perception of
divinity wherever we go, in whatever we perceive ? in the eyes of a child, in the beauty of a
flower, in the flight of a bird. When we begin to experience our life as the miraculous expression
of divinity ? not occasionally, but all the time ? then we will know the true meaning of success.
Before defining the seven spiritual laws, let us understand the concept of law. Law is the
process by which the unmanifest becomes the manifest; it?s the process by which the observer
becomes the observed; it?s the process by which the seer becomes the scenery; it?s the process
through which the dreamer manifests the dream.
All of creation, everything that exists in the physical world, is the result of the unmanifest
transforming itself into the manifest. Everything that we behold comes from the unknown. Our
physical body, the physical universe ? anything and everything that we can perceive through
our senses ? is the transformation of the unmanifest, unknown, and invisible into the manifest,
known, and visible.
The physical universe is nothing other than the Self curving back within Itself to experience
Itself as spirit, mind, and physical matter. In other words, all processes of creation are processes
through which the Self or divinity expresses Itself. Consciousness in motion expresses itself as
the objects of the universe in the eternal dance of life.
The source of all creation is divinity (or the spirit); the process of creation is divinity in
motion (or the mind); and the object of creation is the physical universe (which includes the
physical body). The experience of the Self, or ?self-referral,? means that our internal reference point is our
own spirit, and not the objects of our experience. The opposite of self-referral is object-referral.
In object-referral we are always influenced by objects outside the Self, which include situations,
circumstances, people, and things. In object-referral we are constantly seeking the approval of
others. Our thinking and our behaviour are always in anticipation of a response. It is therefore
fear-based.
In object-referral we also feel an intense need to control things. We feel an intense need for
external power. The need for approval, the need to control things, and the need for external
power are needs that are based on fear. This kind of power is not the power of pure potentiality,
or the power of the Self, or real power. When we experience the power of the Self, there is an
absence of fear, there is no compulsion to control, and no struggle for approval or external
power.
In object-referral, your internal reference point is your ego. The ego, however, is not who
you really are. The ego is your self-image; it is your social mask; it is the role you are playing.
Your social mask thrives on approval. It wants to control, and it is sustained by power, because
it lives in fear.
Your true Self, which is your spirit, your soul, is ^completely free of those things. It is
immune to criticism, it is unfearful of any challenge, and it feels beneath no one. And yet, it is
also humble and feels superior to no one, because it recognizes that everyone else is the same
Self, the same spirit in different disguises. Another way to access the field of pure potentiality is through the practice of non-judg-
ment. Judgment is the constant evaluation of things as right or wrong, good or bad. When you
are constantly evaluating, classifying, labeling, analyzing, you create a lot of turbulence in your
internal dialogue. This turbulence constricts the flow of energy between you and the field of
pure potentiality. You literally squeeze the ?gap? between thoughts.
The gap is your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It is that state of pure aware-
ness, that silent space between thoughts, that inner stillness that connects you to true power.
And when you squeeze the gap, you squeeze your connection to the field of pure potentiality
and infinite creativity.
There is a prayer in A Course in Miracles that states, ?Today I shall judge nothing that
occurs.? Non-judgment creates silence in your mind. It is a good idea, therefore, to begin your
day with that statement. And throughout the day, remind yourself of that statement each time
you catch yourself judging. If practicing this procedure for the whole day seems too difficult,
then you may simply say to yourself, ?For the next two hours, I won?t judge anything,? or ?For
the next hour, I will experience non-judgment.? Then you can extend it gradually.
Through silence, through meditation, and through non-judgment, you will access the first
law, the Law of Pure Potentiality. Once you start doing that, you can add a fourth component
to this practice, and that is regularly spending time in direct communion with nature. Spending
time in nature enables you to sense the harmonious interaction of all the elements and forces of
life, and gives you a sense of unity with all of life. Whether it be a stream, a forest, a mountain,
a lake, or the seashore, that connection with nature?s intelligence will also help you access the
field of pure potentiality.
You must learn to get in touch with the innermost essence of your being. This true essence
is beyond the ego. It is fearless; it is free; it is immune to criticism; it does not fear any challenge.
It is beneath no one, superior to no one, and full of magic, mystery, and enchantment.
Access to your true essence will also give you insight into the mirror of relationship, be-
cause all relationship is a reflection of your relationship with yourself. For example, if you have
guilt, fear, and insecurity over money, or success, or anything else, then these are reflections of
guilt, fear, and insecurity as basic aspects of your personality. No amount of money or success
will solve these basic problems of existence; only intimacy with the Self will bring about true
healing. And when you are grounded in the knowledge of your true Self ? when you really
understand your true nature ? you will never feel guilty, fearful, or insecure about money, or
affluence, or fulfilling your desires, because you will realize that the essence of all material
wealth is life energy, it is pure potentiality. And pure potentiality is your intrinsic nature.
